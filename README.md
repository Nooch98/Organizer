# SOURCE CODE FEATURE AGREE
* Now in the integrated editor it is possible to create custom themes following the template that will be shown to you (You need to copy the chlorophyll folder available above inside the env development environment folder. You must also create in the same folder where you have the code a path that will be ```_internal\chlorophyll\colorscheme```
inside that folder it will copy the themes that are available inside the chloropyll folder provided)
* [!!] If you do not copy the chloropyll folder in the project env, replacing the original folder of the chloropyll library, the themes will not work since the original library is not prepared for the creation and use of custom base themes

## EXAMPLE
### WINDOWS
```C:\User\User\Desktop\Organizer\src\_internal\chlorophyll\colorscheme\```
### LINUX
```~\Desktop\Organizer\src\_internal\chlorophyll\colorscheme\```

* Now also in Windows when you run the app it will recognize the active theme in Windows and will use a corresponding default theme

# NOTES
I have developed this app for the sole reason of having all my programming projects easily accessible since I have too many things, it is not an app that I am going to update very often. But at the moment it is functional and as it says in the in progress section, I am developing and fixing certain things that I will upload. At the moment it is an app to manage programming projects easily and to create new python projects.
THANK YOU
