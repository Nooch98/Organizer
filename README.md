# SOURCE CODE FEATURE AGREE
* Now in the integrated editor it is possible to create custom themes following the template that will be shown to you (You need to copy the [chlorophyll](https://github.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) folder available above inside the env development environment folder. You must also create in the same folder where you have the code a path that will be ```_internal\chlorophyll\colorscheme```
inside that folder it will copy the themes that are available inside the [chlorophyll](https://github.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) folder provided)
* [!!] If you do not copy the [chlorophyll](https://github.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) folder in the project env, replacing the original folder of the [chlorophyll](https://github.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) library, the themes will not work since the original library is not prepared for the creation and use of custom base themes

## EXAMPLE
### WINDOWS
```C:\User\User\Desktop\Organizer\src\_internal\chlorophyll\colorscheme\```
### LINUX
```~\Desktop\Organizer\src\_internal\chlorophyll\colorscheme\```

* Now also in Windows when you run the app it will recognize the active theme in Windows and will use a corresponding default theme


# LAST UPDATES

# NOTES
I have developed this app for the sole reason of having all my programming projects easily accessible since I have too many things, it is not an app that I am going to update very often. But at the moment it is functional and as it says in the in progress section, I am developing and fixing certain things that I will upload. At the moment it is an app to manage programming projects easily and to create new python projects.
THANK YOU
