# ACTUAL FUNCTIONS
* 1- You can create a python project using venv
* 2- You can add projects from any language you already have on your team
* 3- You can open any of the previously added projects from the editor you select
* 4- You can directly open a github project by giving it the github url and the app will clone it and open the project. Added to this, it will also be saved in the organizer so you can add a description to know more about the projects since the name will use the name of the repository. Even so, it is recommended to create a folder to save this repository to avoid possible failures of the app since that function is not yet completely finished.
* 5- You can delete projects completely from your PC
* 6- If the projects that have been saved have a github repository and the repository url has been added, you can access it by double clicking on the url

# IN PROGRESS
* [ ] In the function of creating a new project, i'm in the process of adding more supported languages ​​such as node js (javascript), c++, java etc.
* [ ] Now in the application in the settings area you have to add the exes of the editors that are not in the path. I'm working on making that not necessary.
* [ ] I am working on adding some other options such as being able to order the projects as each user sees fit.
* [ ] I am working on adding a search function in case there are many saved projects.

# NOTES
I have developed this app for the sole reason of having all my programming projects easily accessible since I have too many things, it is not an app that I am going to update very often. But at the moment it is functional and as it says in the in progress section, I am developing and fixing certain things that I will upload. At the moment it is an app to manage programming projects easily and to create new python projects.
THANK YOU
