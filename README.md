# IN PROGRESS
* [ ] In the function of creating a new project, i'm in the process of adding more supported languages ​​such as node js (javascript), c++, java etc.
* [ ] Now in the application in the settings area you have to add the exes of the editors that are not in the path. I'm working on making that not necessary.
* [ ] I am working on adding some other options such as being able to order the projects as each user sees fit.
* [ ] I am working on adding a search function in case there are many saved projects.

# NOTES
I have developed this app for the sole reason of having all my programming projects easily accessible since I have too many things, it is not an app that I am going to update very often. But at the moment it is functional and as it says in the in progress section, I am developing and fixing certain things that I will upload. At the moment it is an app to manage programming projects easily and to create new python projects.
THANK YOU
