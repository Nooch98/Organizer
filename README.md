# NOTES
I have developed this app for the sole reason of having all my programming projects easily accessible since I have too many things, it is not an app that I am going to update very often. But at the moment it is functional and as it says in the in progress section, I am developing and fixing certain things that I will upload. At the moment it is an app to manage programming projects easily and to create new python projects.
THANK YOU
